# Minesweeper
Minesweeper from scratch, all in one class (FRESHMAN YEAR PROJECT)

I made this project as a refresher over winter break of 2021.
I'm sure I could go back now and make it much better, but I don't have time.

The way that you interact with the tiles on the board is a little covoluted and needs to be simpler.
I need to put in a catch for input mismatch.

Either way this was a fun project to work on and I was happy I was able to do it myself.
